## Theory

Here's a video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC1bTDBz46k&t=512s> explaining more about central limit theorem.

As you can see it's very important to set values for:
- k: number of samples that you are taking
- n: number of elements per sample

## How to execute it?

- Go to the "General Input Parameters" Section of the index.R script.
- Set your k (it's better a big value).
- Set nSizes: This vector represent the n size that will be computed for different scenarios
- overwrite data variable with a vector of numeric values.


## What's the result?

As you can see there's a bunch of histograms as a result of execution. The idea is that you can compare normal distributions according to different n sizes and it's relation with the "data" histogram
